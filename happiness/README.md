- **year**: The year the data was collected, ranging from 2005 to 2023.
- **Life Ladder**: A measure representing life satisfaction, with higher values indicating greater satisfaction.
- **Log GDP per capita**: The natural log of GDP per capita, providing an economic context for the Life Ladder score.
- **Social support**: A metric indicating the perceived support from family, friends, and the community.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: The average number of years that a newborn can expect to live in good health.
- **Freedom to make life choices**: A perception of freedom individuals feel they have to make choices concerning their lives.
- **Generosity**: A measure of the willingness to give to others.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: The level of corruption perceived in government and business.

  - Missing values: 0 (0.00% of total).

## Visual Analysis

### Life Ladder Distribution Across Years
![Life Ladder Distribution Across Years](boxplot_life_ladder_years.png)
The image presents a box plot titled "Life Ladder Distribution Across Years." Hereâ€™s an analysis based on the visible elements:

#### Description of the Graph
- **Type of Graph**: Box Plot summarizing the distribution of Life Ladder scores across years from 2005 to 2023.

#### Key Observations
- The overall trend shows stability in median scores around 5.
- Increased variability in box plots and notable outliers in 2020 and 2023 indicate fluctuations in well-being.

#### Implications
- This consistency suggests a resilient societal framework but highlights the need for further investigation into outlier years' conditions.

### Relationship Between Life Ladder and Log GDP per Capita

This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the Life Ladder score on the y-axis and Log GDP per Capita on the x-axis.

#### Description of the Graph
- **Key Features**: Shows positive correlation; as economic output increases, happiness scores tend to increase as well.

#### Key Observations
- Most points cluster in mid-range scores, emphasizing that while GDP influences happiness, many additional factors are at play.

#### Implications
- The correlation indicates economic robustness is crucial for quality of life, but it highlights the complexity of the factors affecting life satisfaction.

### Top 10 Countries by Average Life Ladder Score

The provided image is a bar graph titled "Top 10 Countries by Average Life Ladder Score." 

#### Description of the Graph
- **Type**: Bar graph comparing average Life Ladder scores across 10 leading countries.

#### Key Observations
- Scores for these countries are predominantly above 7, indicating high life satisfaction and consistency in well-being.

#### Implications
- Suggests effective policies and economic stability in these nations contribute significantly to high life satisfaction ratings.

## How the Analysis Was Carried Out
The analysis involved several steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Ensuring non-null values for significant numerical variables and examining categorical data.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Calculating mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for numerical analysis.
3. Visual Representation: Creating box plots, scatter plots, and bar graphs to visualize data trends, correlations, and distributions.
4. Insight Generation: Interpreting visual and statistical data to derive meaningful implications regarding happiness and life satisfaction across various contexts.

## Findings
The analysis highlighted several key discoveries:
- **Trends**: Life satisfaction scores appear generally stable, with variations suggesting periods of significant change.
- **Correlations**: A positive relationship between Log GDP per Capita and the Life Ladder score indicates economic factors significantly relate to happiness.
- **Outliers**: Certain years displayed drops in scores, which may require deeper examination to understand societal shifts.
- **Country Comparisons**: The top-performing countries demonstrate that effective governance and social support play critical roles in enhancing life satisfaction.

Overall, this dataset provides a comprehensive view into the factors affecting happiness and can guide policymakers and researchers in improving societal well-being.
